# How to run file locally

1. Download MAMP on a mac or XAMP on Windows.
2. Clone the repository inside the htdocs folder which can be found inside the root folder of MAMP.
3. Setup ports on MAMP.
4. Open browser and type in http://localhost or http://localhost:8888 which is the default when using MAMP. This should now display the folders inside the htdocs folder.
5. Navigate to the folder and locate the public folder. The url in your browser should be something like http://localhost:8888/swapi-task/public/. Make sure the public folder is accessed, otherwise the page cannot be viewed.

You should now be able to view the page in your browser.
