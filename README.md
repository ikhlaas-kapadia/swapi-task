# How to run file locally

1. Download MAMP on a mac or XAMP on Windows. This should setup the technologies required to work on this project.
2. Clone the repository inside the htdocs folder which can be found inside the root folder of MAMP.
3. Setup ports on MAMP.
4. Open your browser and type in http://localhost or http://localhost:8888(which is set by default when using MAMP). The browser should now display the folders inside the htdocs folder.
5. Navigate to the folder /swapi-task and click on the public folder. The url in your browser should be something like http://localhost:8888/swapi-task/public/. Make sure the public folder is accessed, otherwise the page cannot be viewed.

You should now be able to view the webpage in your browser.
